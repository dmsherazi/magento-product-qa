== Usage

=== General
You can find the module in admin under Catalog menu: Product Q&A.
If you don't want a question do be displayed in the front-end product view just set the status to hidden. The question are displayed in the front-end view only if the store is the same store where the question was originally posted and if the question is answered.

The module configuration is in Admin->System->Configuration->Catalog->Product Q&A.
From the configuration area you can set:
* send an email or not to the poster when a question is answered
* receive notification email when a question is posted
* set the email where you want to receive the notification

There are two email templates:
* one that is received by the poster when a question is answered: app/locale/en_US/template/email/pws_productqa/product_qa_answer.html.
* one that is received by the admin when a question is posted: app/locale/en_US/template/email/pws_productqa/product_qa_notification.html.

The email sender is 'general' (the email address set in Admin->System->Configuration->General->Store Email Addresses->General contact). You can change the sender from the module's config.xml file.
